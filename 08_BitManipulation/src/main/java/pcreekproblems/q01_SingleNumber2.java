     * Approach 0:
     *  What we need to do is to store the number of '1's of every bit. Since each of the 32 bits follow the same rules,
     *  we just need to consider 1 bit. We know a number appears 3 times at most, so we need 2 bits to store that.
     *  Now we have 4 state, 00, 01, 10 and 11, but we only need 3 of them.
     *
     *  In this solution, 00, 01 and 10 are chosen. Let 'ones' represents the first bit, 'twos' represents the second bit.
     *  Then we need to set rules for 'ones' and 'twos' so that they act as we hopes.
     *  The complete loop is 00->01->10->00(0->1->2->3/0).
     *
     *  For 'ones', we can get 'ones = ones ^ A[i]; if (twos == 1) then ones = 0',
     *  that can be transformed to 'ones = (ones ^ A[i]) & ~twos'.
     *  Similarly, for 'twos', we can get 'twos = twos ^ A[i]; if (ones* == 1) then twos = 0' and 'twos = (twos ^ A[i]) & ~ones'.
     *  Notice that 'ones*' is the value of 'ones' after calculation, that is why twos is calculated later.

     *  To get the result, check if the number can be divided by 3 (mod 3 = 0), put '0' if true and '1' otherwise.
     *
     *  We only consider the right most bit of each number, and count the number of bits that equals to 1.
     *  "uniq" is the number that appears only once and "uniqBit" is the rightmost bit of "uniq"

     * Approach 2:
     *  Transition table
     *  r is the corresponding bit of a number in the array. If r = 1,
     *  we have the following transitions: (00 + 1 = 01), (01 + 1 = 10), (10 + 1 = 00 -> coz when count becomes 3, we init it to 0).
     *  (The + means the transition with condition that we met bit 1).

     *  and (p, q) represents the state after that.

     *  --------------------------------------------
