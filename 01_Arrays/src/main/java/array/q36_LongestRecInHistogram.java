 * Problem:
 *  Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1,
 *  find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.
 *  a histogram where width of each bar is 1 and given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3], The largest rectangle has area = 10 unit

    /**
     * Approach:
     *  The key to solve this problem is to maintain a stack to store bars' indexes. The stack only keeps the increasing bars.
     *  Do push all heights including 0 height.
     *  i - 1 - s.peek() uses the starting index where height[s.peek() + 1] >= height[top], because the index on
     *      top of the stack right now is the first index left of top with height smaller than topâ€™s height.
