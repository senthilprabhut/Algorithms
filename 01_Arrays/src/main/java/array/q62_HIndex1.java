/**
 * Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
 *
 * Problem:
 *  Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
 *  According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
 *  For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
 *  Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
 *
 *  Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

    /**
     * Approach: Bucket Sort
     *  The definition of the index is that a scholar with an index of h has published h papers each of which has been cited in other papers at least h times.
     *  Thus, the h-index reflects both the number of publications and the number of citations per publication.
     *  Since h index is both no of publication and no of citations, it is always <= no of papers - which from above example is 5
     *
     *  The counts vector stores the number of papers having a citation equal to its index for i=0 to L-1.
     *  For i=L, it stores the number of papers having a citation equal to or greater than L.
     *  After finalizing the counts vector, we can then easily locate his h-index by scanning from right (L) to left (0).
     *  By definition, index k is his h-index if the summation of all elements from counts[k] to counts[L] is no less than k.
