/**
 * Difficulty Level: HARD
 *
 * Problem:
 *  Given an array of words and a length L, format the text such that each line has exactly L characters and
 *  is fully (left and right) justified.
 *  You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line.
 *  Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly L characters.
 *  Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible.
 *  If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words,
 *  the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
 *  For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.
 *  For example, words: ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]  L: 16.
 *  Return the formatted lines as:
 *  [
 *      "This    is    an",
 *      "example  of text",
 *      "justification.  "
 *  ]
 *  Note: Each word is guaranteed not to exceed L in length.
 *  Corner Cases:
 *      A line other than the last line might contain only one word. What should you do in this case?
 *      In this case, that line should be left-justified.

    /**
     * Approach:
     *  For each line, I first figure out which words can fit in. According to the code, these words are words[i] through words[i+k-1].
     *  Then spaces are added between the words.
     *  The trick here is to use mod operation to manage the spaces that canâ€™t be evenly distrubuted:
     *  the first (L-l) % (k-1) gaps acquire an additional space.
