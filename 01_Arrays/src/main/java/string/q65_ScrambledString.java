/**
 * Difficulty Level: HARD
 *
 * Problem:
 *  Given a string s1, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively.
 *  Below is one possible representation of s1 = "great":
 *      great
 *     /    \
 *    gr    eat
 *   / \    /  \
 *  g   r  e   at
 *            / \
 *           a   t
 *  To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children.
 *  For example, if we choose the node "gr" and swap its two children, it produces a scrambled string "rgeat".
 *            rgeat
 *           /    \
 *          rg    eat
 *         / \    /  \
 *        r   g  e   at
 *                  / \
 *                 a   t
 *  We say that "rgeat" is a scrambled string of "great".
 *  Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes "eat" and "at", it produces a scrambled string "rgtae".
 *            rgtae
 *           /    \
 *          rg    tae
 *         / \    /  \
 *        r   g  ta  e
 *              / \
 *             t   a
 *  We say that "rgtae" is a scrambled string of "great".
 *  Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, determine if s2 is a scrambled string of s1.

    /**
     * Approach:
     *  The 1st IF is to check the LEFT child of S1 is scramble of LEFT child of S2 AND RIGHT child of S1 is also a scramble of RIGHT child of s2.
     *  When this fails, it means the left and right substrings are swapped.
     *  The 2nd IF statement check for the swap case with LEFT child of S1 and RIGHT child of S2 AND RIGHT child of S1 and LEFT child of S2.
