/**
 * Difficulty Level: HARD
 *
 * Problem:
 *  Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
 *  Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
 *  Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
 *  For example:    Given array A = [2,3,1,1,4]
 *  The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. (Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.)
 *  Note:  You can assume that you can always reach the last index.

     * Approach: Single Loop DP
     *  Letâ€™s say the range of the current jump is [curBegin, curEnd], curFarthest is the farthest point that all points in [curBegin, curEnd] can reach.
     *  Once the current point reaches curEnd, then trigger another jump, and set the new curEnd with curFarthest, then keep the above steps
