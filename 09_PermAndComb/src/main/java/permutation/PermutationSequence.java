/**
 * Problem:
 *  The set [1,2,3,â€¦,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
 *  By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
 *  We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):

 *  "312"
 *  "321"
 *
 *  Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

     * Algorithm:
     *  say n = 4, you have {1, 2, 3, 4}. We also know the number of permutations of n numbers is n! (4 numbers = 4! = 24)
     *
     *  If you were to list out all the permutations for above list, you have 1 + (permutations of 2, 3, 4),
     *  2 + (permutations of 1, 3, 4), 3 + (permutations of 1, 2, 4), 4 + (permutations of 1, 2, 3)
     *  Each of ones in above list with permutations of 3 numbers will have 6 (3! = 6) possible permutations.
     *  So there would be a total of 24 permutations (1*3! + 1*3! + 1*3! + 1*3! = 24)
     *  So if you were to look for the (k = 14) 14th permutation, it would be in the 3 + (permutations of 1, 2, 4) subset
     *
     *  To programmatically get that, you take k = 13 (subtract 1 because of things always starting at 0) and
     *  divide that by the 6 we got from the factorial, which would give you the index of the number you want
     *  In the array {1, 2, 3, 4}, n=4 and with k=13,  k/(n-1)! = 13/(4-1)! = 13/3! = 13/6 = 2.
     *  The array {1, 2, 3, 4} has a value of 3 at index 2. So the first number is a 3 (for the 14th permutation).
     *
     *  Now, the problem repeats with less numbers. The permutations of {1, 2, 4} would be:
     *  1 + (permutations of 2, 4), 2 + (permutations of 1, 4), 4 + (permutations of 1, 2)
     *  And k is not 13 any more since we eliminated 12 4-number permutations starting with 1 and 2
     *  (1 + permutations of (2, 3, 4) &  2 + permutations of (1, 3, 4) which is 1*3! + 1*3! = 12 numbers).
     *  And 1*3 & 1*3 are 2 sets eliminated which is the same as the index we got previously.
     *  So you subtract 12 from k.. which gives you 1.
     *
     *  Programmatically that would be k = k - [(index from previous) * (n-1)!] = k - 2*(n-1)! = 13 - 2*(3)! = 1
     *  The index to get number from is k / (n - 2)! = 1 / (4-2)! = 1 / 2! = 0.
     *  From sub-array {1, 2, 4}, index 0 is 1 which is our second number of the 14th permutation
     *
     *  Now, the problem repeats with less numbers. The permutations of {2, 4} would be 2 + (Perm 4), 4 + (Perm 2)
     *  New k = k - [(index from prev) * (n-2)!] = 1 - [0 * 2!] = 1 - 0 = 1
     *  New index = k / (n-3)! = 1 / (4-3)! = 1/1 = 1
     *  From sub-array {2,4}, index 1 is 4 which is our 3rd number of the 14th permutation
     *
     *  The last permutation set is {2}
     *  k = k - [(index from pervious) * (n - 3)!] = k - [1 * (4 - 3)!] = 1 - 1 = 0;
     *  Third number's index = k / (n - 4)! = 0 / (4-4)! = 0/ 1 = 0.
     *  From sub-array {2}, index 0 has 2. Fourth number is 2 giving us 3142
