/**
 * Problem:
 *  Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find single source shortest path in directed graph.
 *  Doesn't work with negative edges
 *
 * Approach:
 *  Dijkstra(Graph G, Source S)
 *      Initialize Source with distance 0 and rest of the nodes with distance from source as âˆž
 *      Shortest path set SP = empty set
 *      Build min heap with list of Vertices - the min heap is sorted on the distance of vertices from Source
 *      While (heap is not empty)
 *          u = Extract-Min(heap)
 *          SP = SP{u}
 *          for each Vertex v in Adjacents[u]
 *              Relax(u,v) //Relax is decrease-key operation
 *
 * Links:
 *  Ravindra Dijkstra algorithm
 *  Tushar - https://youtu.be/lAXZGERcDf4
 *  Solution - https://github.com/mission-peace/interview/blob/master/src/com/interview/graph/DijkstraShortestPath.java
 *
 * Complexity:
 *  Space complexity - O(E + V)
 *  Time complexity - O(E logV)
 *      Initialize - O(V), Build heap - O(V), Extract Min - V*log(V), Decrease key (Relax) - E*log(V)
 *      Total = O(V + V + V logV + E logV) = E logV (most significant value)
